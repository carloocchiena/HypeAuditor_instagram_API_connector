# HypeAuditor_instagram_API_connector
A python script that connect to HypeAuditor API and get some Instagram Data 

for privacy reasons this is done on the HypeAuditor sandbox but the process is exactly the same for prod environment.

the excel output is not yet polished due to the relative complexity of the dataframe, planning to update this sooner or later.

contributions are welcome!
